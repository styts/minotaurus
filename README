I, as the developer, want to easily bootstrap a django project.

Problem: When starting a new project, the very first 2 days of work
are spent on common tasks, such as:

* taking a h5bp template
* integrating bootstrap
* django_compile integration: bootstrap's less file and the application's
    main less file need to be compiled

When such a template exists, it is executed with the project name as argument
to start a project.

At some later stage in the project, a django web app will be built on top of
this library, allowing others to submit via github their forks (with parameters).

    These parameres will be availible to the webapp user to choose from (and save)

    The above noch ein mal:
        ***jsut write it in code already***


Start a site with a simple bootstrap template.
OpenShift provisioning via fab command
